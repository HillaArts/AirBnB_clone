# AirBnB Clone Project Console
## The AirBnB Clone project is a part of a larger web application development. It invloves building a command-line interface(CLI) for managing AirBnB objects. This project focuses on creating a foundation for the AirBnB application, including defining object classes, serialization, deserialization and basic object strorage. Command Interpreter The command interpreter is a fundamental component of this project. It allows users to interact with the system and manage various AirBnB objects. The interpreter provides the following functionalities: Create new objects, such as User, State, City, Place, etc. Retrieve objects from storage (file, database, etc.). Perform operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, and more. Update attributes of objects. Delete objects from the system.
## Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
## Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
## Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
## Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
## Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
